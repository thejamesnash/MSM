                    Balance transfers
                    Thanks for that – we think a 0% balance transfer card can help you. This is where you get a new card, then ‘do a balance transfer’ from it to your old card (usually for a small one-off fee), meaning the balance on the old card is cleared, and you owe the new card, but at 0%. This means more of your repayments clear the debt, rather than just paying off the interest, so you can be debt free quicker, and often save £100s or even £1,000s in interest. 
                    Does this sound like what you’re looking for? 
                    If so, with a few questions, we can check your chances of getting a range of balance transfer cards. 
                    Or, you can go and see what cards are available first.

                    Great, looks like a 0% spending card could be the answer. These cards allow you to spend on them, and then give you some time with 0% interest to pay it off – though you’ll still need to make at least the minimum payment each month to keep the 0% deal.

                    Rewards
                    Make your spending work for you with a rewards card. Every time you spend on one of these, you’ll collect points, or airmiles, or even get cashback. But, they’re only suitable if you pay off in full every month, else you’ll pay more in interest than the rewards are worth. If you won’t, then a {0% spending card} or a {low rate card} could be a better option.

                    Great, there are a few cards designed for spending abroad. Unlike normal credit cards, these cards don’t charge an exchange fee when you spend in a foreign currency, meaning you just pay for what you spend, and not the bank’s exchange fee as well.

                    Credit builder
                    Not to worry – we’ve all been there with our credit score. And there are a few cards that could help you build (or rebuild) your credit score. If you get one of these cards, then do a small amount of spending each month on it, making sure that you pay the card off in full at the end of the month, after a while – assuming you’re managing other credit well too – this should contribute to an improved credit score. You will need to use the card for it to have an effect – just having the card won’t help. Just ensure you’re sensible, and only put what you can afford to repay on it. However, getting a credit card isn’t the only thing you can do to boost your credit score. We’ve {much more help}.

                    0% BT & spend
                    Sure, it’s not all about one thing or the other. And, some cards are good for balance transfers AND purchases at the same time, letting you both borrow and pay off your debt at 0%. Balance transfers are where you get a new card, then ‘transfer’ money from it to your old card (usually for a small one-off fee), meaning the balance on the old card is cleared, and you owe the new card, but at 0%. This means more of your repayments clear the debt, rather than just paying off the interest, so you can be debt free quicker, and often save £100s or even £1,000s in interest. 0% spending cards allow you to spend on them, and then give you some time with 0% interest to pay it off. And these cards let you do both. Watch out though - you’ll still need to make at least the minimum payment each month to keep the 0% deal.

                    Money transfers
                    Sounds odd, but some cards do let you do a money transfer – where you transfer cash off the card into your bank account (for a small one-off fee), meaning you owe the card provider. Once you have the money in your bank account, you can use it as if it was a loan – maybe to pay off an overdraft or payday loan with higher interest, or maybe to buy something where the vendor can’t (or won’t) take payment by credit card. Usually these cards give you a 0% period, which it’s best to use to budget to pay the card off. Plus, you’ll still need to make at least the minimum payment each month to keep the 0% deal.
